## overview
This lab was a large learning curve for me as I am new to d3 I tried to use powerbi in interaction with mongodb, because I have experience using powerbi with microsoft sql server management studio but for some reason powerbi cannot be downloadex onto my mac, and then I decided to use d3, but then when I tried to log into mongo on compass and the web I kept getting weird errors, so I just used the data directly from the API, because I would rather have something to present than a blank visual.

I tried using chatgpt to help with the errors I was getting from compass and mongo, but all of the prompts I used gave nothing useful, so I will put the prompts, but they were not really used:
    "how to fix this error on mongodb compass:1133880680512:error:10000438:SSL routines:OPENSSL_internal:TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR:../../third_party/boringssl/src/ssl/tls_record.cc:592:SSL alert number 80"
    then a chain of whatever it told me did not work
