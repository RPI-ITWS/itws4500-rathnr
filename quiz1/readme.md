resource for axios use:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios
used the documentation so :
https://www.boredapi.com/documentation
The creativity aspect that I tried to include was the ability to choose an activity based on all 4 aspects though separately as I am not sure if the api allows them simultaneously(the documentation didn't seem to show that) one can search for an activity based on number of people, price, accessibility, or type in whichever way they want
