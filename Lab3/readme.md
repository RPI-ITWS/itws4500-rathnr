A lot of the code I used was learned through stack overflow, and other similar sources like w3 schools
My articles.Json file was created using an API called currents API
I cannot use the openweathermap API all that well as my old api key no longer works and when I tried to make a new account and get a new one it did not give me an api key to use, so I did all of it but without the working open weather map api
