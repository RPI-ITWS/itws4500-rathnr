i spent a long time figuring out the process of moving the data from the external api into mongo
after I figured that out I spent most of my time on the db endpoint, and a little bit of time following that on react, and the .env was the first thing I did.

sources:
I had a lot of trouble loading the data into the database so I used a lot of sources for that:
